<p>The option "Recordings" of the menu "PBX" in Elastix allows creating audio files from the recording of our voice. Also you can upload audio files from your hard disk. This option is only available if the connected user has an extension assigned to his account.</p>

<p>To record an audio file, you have to enter the name of the recording and click on "Record" button. When your extension is ringing, answer the phone and start your voice recording after the tone. When done press '#' and hang up the phone. Click on "Save" button to save the recording.</p>
