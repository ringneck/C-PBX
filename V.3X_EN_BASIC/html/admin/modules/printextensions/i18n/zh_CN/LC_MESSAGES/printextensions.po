"You can narrow the list of extensions based on a search criteria. If you "
"search for an exact extension number the page will redirect to the edit page "
"for the given number. You can also do a bounded or unbounded regex search. "
"The bounded search simply encloses you search criteria between a '^' and '$' "
"where as an unbounded one is completely free form. All normal regex patterns "
"are acceptable in your search. So for example, a bounded search of 20\\d\\d "
"would search for all extensions of the form 20XX. The resulting lists of "
"numbers all contain links to go directly to the edit pages and the Printer "
"Friendly page will reflect the filtered list of numbers."
