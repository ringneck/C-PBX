msgid "Settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module implements the Call Completion Supplemental Services (CCSS) "
"often referred to as Call Camping or Camp-On. It allows a caller to request "
"the system call them back when a busy or non-responding extension becomes "
"available. Requires Asterisk 1.8 or higher."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maximum Active Camp-On Requests"
msgstr ""

msgid "Camp-On Module"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"System wide maximum number of outstanding Camp-On requests that can be "
"active. This limit is useful on a system that may have memory constraints "
"since the internal state machine takes up system resources relative to the "
"number of active requests it has to track. Restart Asterisk for changes to "
"take effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Non Extensions Callee Policy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this is set to 'generic' or 'always' then it will be possible to attempt "
"call completion requests when dialing non-extensions such as ring groups and "
"other possible destinations that could work with call completion. Setting "
"this will bypass any Callee Policies and can result in inconsistent "
"behavior. If set, 'generic' is the most common, 'always' will attempt to use "
"technology specific capabilities if the called extension uses a channel that "
"supports that."
msgstr ""

msgid "Only Use Default Camp-On Settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can force all extensions on a system to only used the default Camp-On "
"settings. When in this mode, the individual settings will not be shown on "
"the extension page. If there were unique settings previously configured, the "
"data will be retained but not used unless you switch this back to false. "
"With this set, the Caller Policy (cc_agent_policy) and Callee Policy "
"(cc_monitor_policy) settings will still be configurable for each user so you "
"can still enable/disable Call Camping ability on select extensions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caller Policy Default"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Asterisk: cc_agent_policy. Used to enable Camp-On for a user and set the "
"Technology Mode that will be used when engaging the feature. In most cases "
"'generic' should be chosen unless you have phones designed to work with "
"channel specific capabilities."
msgstr ""

msgid "Callee Policy Default"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Asterisk: cc_monitor_policy. Used to control if other phones are allowed to "
"Camp On to an extension. If so, it sets the technology mode used to monitor "
"the availability of the extension. If no specific technology support is "
"available then it should be set to a 'generic'. In this mode, a callback "
"will be initiated to the extension when it changes from an InUse state to "
"NotInUse. If it was busy when first attempted, this will be when the current "
"call has eneded. If it simply did not answer, then this will be the next "
"time this phone is used to make or answer a call and then hangs up. It is "
"possible to set this to take advantage of 'native' technology support if "
"available and automatically fallback to 'generic' whe not by setting it to "
"'always'."

msgstr ""

msgid "Default Caller Callback Mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Affects Asterisk: cc_agent_dialstring. If not set a callback request will be "
"dialed straight to the speciifc device that made the call. If using 'native' "
"technology support this may be the peferred mode. The 'internal' (Callback "
"Standard) option will intiate a call back to the caller just as if someone "
"else on the system placed the call, which means the call can pursue Follow-"
"Me. To avoid Follow-Me setting, choose 'extension' (Callback Extension)."
